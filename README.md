# Computer_Vision_Projects

## Description

This repository contains computer vision projects focused on different techniques and approaches:

1. **Camera Calibration**
2. **Stereo Vision**
3. **Object Recognition with SIFT Descriptor**

Each project explores specific aspects of computer vision, with detailed code and methodologies for each technique.

## Projects

### 1. **Camera Calibration**

Camera calibration is a crucial process for obtaining accurate camera parameters to correct distortions and achieve precise measurements. This project focuses on using calibration techniques to estimate camera parameters from photos of a calibration pattern.

- **Code Repository**: [Camera_Calibration](./Camera_Calibration)
- **Data**: Calibration images can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

### 2. **Stereo Vision**

Stereo vision is used to obtain three-dimensional information about a scene by combining images taken from two cameras placed at different positions. This project explores techniques to create depth maps and reconstruct 3D scenes from stereo image pairs.

- **Code Repository**: [Image_Stereo](./Image_Stereo)
- **Data**: Stereo vision datasets are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

### 3. **Object Recognition with SIFT Descriptor**

The SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptor is used to detect and describe local features in images, enabling object recognition and image matching. This project implements algorithms to detect and recognize objects in images using SIFT.

- **Code Repository**: [SIFT_Object_Recognition](./SIFT_Object_Recognition)
- **Data**: Object recognition datasets are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Installation

Make sure to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-image matplotlib
```

## Usage

Each project contains Python scripts with instructions on how to run analyses and visualize results. Refer to the individual `README` files in each project directory for specific usage details.
